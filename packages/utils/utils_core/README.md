# Utils (Core)

This package exports utilities.

Many of the utilities here are really simple extensions or functions that are shortcuts to commonly-repeated patterns. You can see these in the `coerce`, `extensions`, and `type` directories.

You can find `README.md` files in the other directories which will explain that utility in more detail.
