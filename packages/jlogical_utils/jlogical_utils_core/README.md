# JLogical Utils (Core)

This simply exports all core packages out.

This allows you to easily `import 'package:jlogical_utils_core/jlogical_utils_core.dart'` in a Dart file
and have all of the core JLogical Utils easily available to use.

Use this when building a library that doesn't depend on Flutter.
